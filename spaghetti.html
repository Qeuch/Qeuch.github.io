        Spaghetti's origins sparked in Cornwall, under the name of Loki, owned by a former partner of that time. Housing was not ideal,
        he resided with several other cats, and a poorly trained dog of massive proportions. Within these wicked times,
        Spaghetti developed an inner ear infection, which was left untreated and written off as a stroke. Deprived from half of
        his motor functions, 6 month old Spaghetti did not fare well in his home. As such, the decision was made that I would take
        Spaghetti with me to my studies in Halifax. And so the trip was made, Spaghetti and I left in the early hours of the morning
        to take on Halifax together, and thus began our escapades on the eastern coast of Canada, where he would discover his love for all foods.

        Spaghetti's first coastal residence was in Dartmouth, down the water from the MacDonald Bridge, subletting from some young swindlers.
        Although they housed two dogs, a baby gate was an effective way of separating them, counting Spaghetti's inability to jump as a blessing in this case.
        Spaghetti's time in Dartmouth did not last long. Due to financial crisis, we moved together in a trap house in central Halifax with a few new friends, and the current flame.
        His disabilities were praised beyond belief. Tender loving care was around every corner for Spaghetti, as "The Trap" housed nearly half a dozen, and many more came passing through
        the often-open door. Treats and food flowed from every hand and plate, he grew in size and health, from a scrawny kitten to a chonky cat. To my own disbelief,
        his ability to run and mount stairs greatly improved. He began to jump on low sofas with the motivation of food, and climbed the stairs to greet his animal roomates: Rat DeMarco and Rico Nasty, with which he grew close.

          Around this time in Halifax, Spaghetti's previous owner formed claims on Spaghetti out of spite. I began receiving death threats and being called a "catnapper", but the sheer distance left me with no worries.
          I was financially unable to attend Dalhousie University at the time, so most of my time was spent enjoying my twenties in Halifax. Spaghetti's reign as the trap cat continued for a while, but eventually
          our return to Cornwall became inevitable; I needed my safety net to get out of the coastal grooves. However, this meant much more trouble for Spaghetti than anticipated.
